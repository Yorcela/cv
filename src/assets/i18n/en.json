My style is resolutely <strong>human, collaborative, and results-oriented</strong>.</p><p>The teams I support describe my approach as motivating and engaging. I create the conditions for everyone to progress, build confidence, and gain autonomy.

My leadership is based on <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>excellence</strong>.</p><p>On the human side, my strengths lie in my ability to rally, motivate, and inspire. I’m known for my <strong>empathy</strong>, my knack for <strong>building authentic relationships</strong>, and my <strong>spontaneity</strong>, which make collaboration natural and enjoyable. I’m also a <strong>driver of innovation and change:</strong> I like to understand the why, challenge the status quo pragmatically, test new approaches, learn fast, and iterate.</p><h4>What defines me as a manager</h4><ul><li><strong>People first:</strong> I value individual and collective growth, love shining a light on others’ talent, and easily spot each person’s potential.</li><li><strong>Coach & visionary:</strong> I help people grow and rally around a common goal, encouraging both team and individual objectives.</li><li><strong>Catalyst:</strong> I turn challenges into opportunities and spark collective energy, surrounding myself with <em>early adopters</em> to support transformation.</li><li><strong>Structured & pragmatic:</strong> I design clear, realistic (yet ambitious) frameworks suited to business stakes while staying pragmatic and incremental.</li></ul><p>In short, I’m a <strong>servant leader</strong> who radiates enthusiasm, closeness, and the will to have a global, positive, and lasting impact. My drive: helping a company grow by creating an environment where people and products thrive together.</p>"
