        "message": "<p>I had the incredible opportunity to work with Alec when he joined SantéVet as Lead Scrum Master and as my direct manager. I had clear views on the kind of management I wanted, but being relatively new to Agile, I had high expectations. As it turned out, not only did Alec meet them—he far exceeded them.</p><p>He quickly grasped the company context and immediately started proposing relevant improvements. Within just a few days, it felt like he had always been part of the Agile team—integrating seamlessly and bringing people together to spark new ideas. In only a few months after his arrival, teams improved significantly on many aspects: better planning, finishing more of what they start, managing dependencies more effectively, and communicating more efficiently.</p><p>He masters agility and is an excellent mentor—but above all, he’s inspiring!</p><p>He embodies the definition of a servant leader. You can come to him with a problem at any time; he’ll always be ready to help—either by helping you realize you already have a solution or by providing tools or ideas to solve it.</p><p>I couldn’t have hoped for a better leader or manager. His future teams will be very lucky to have him. When you find someone like Alec, with such skills and mindset, it would be senseless to let him go. He’s one of the exceptional ones.</p>"
