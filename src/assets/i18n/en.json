    "description": "Lean and Agile Leader with nearly 15 years of experience at the crossroads of product, tech, business and management, I have supported scale-ups (ManoMano, SantéVet, Dougs…) in their hyper-growth by structuring delivery, leading agile transformations at scale and developing talent. My style is human, collaborative and results-oriented. I create the conditions for everyone to grow, gain autonomy and find meaning. Strategic vision and coaching posture come together in my leadership: transparency, trust and excellence. Recognized for my ability to unite, motivate and inspire, I bring empathy, spontaneity and pragmatism. As an innovation driver, I challenge the status quo, test, learn and iterate. In short, a passionate servant leader, driven by the desire to contribute to the growth of a company where people and products grow together."

  "aboutLong": {
    "description": "I am a Lean/Agile leader and passionate manager, with nearly 15 years of experience at the crossroads of product, tech, business, and management.\n\nI have supported my teams in scale-ups (ManoMano, SantéVet, Dougs…) during hyper-growth by structuring delivery, leading agile transformations at scale, and developing talent. My style is resolutely human, collaborative, and results-oriented.\n\nThe teams I work with describe my approach as motivating and engaging. I create the conditions for everyone to grow, gain confidence, and become autonomous. I combine strategic vision (roadmaps aligned with the company's global strategy, adaptation of frameworks to context) with a coaching posture (mentoring, active listening, constructive feedback). My leadership is built on transparency, trust, and excellence.\n\nOn a human level, my strengths lie in my ability to unite, motivate, and inspire. I am recognized for my empathy, my ability to build authentic relationships, and my spontaneity, which make collaboration natural and enjoyable. I am also a driver of innovation and change: I like to understand the \"why,\" challenge the status quo pragmatically, test new approaches, learn quickly, and iterate.\n\nWhat defines me as a manager:\n• People first: I value individual and collective growth, highlight the talent of others, and easily detect everyone's potential.\n• Coach & visionary: I help people grow and lead them toward a shared goal, encouraging the definition of collective and individual objectives.\n• Catalyst: I turn challenges into opportunities and stimulate collective energy, surrounding myself with early adopters to support transformation.\n• Structured & pragmatic: I design clear, realistic (yet ambitious) frameworks."
